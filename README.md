## Hello there!

**My name is Yiyi Luo** and I am a Data scientist with a Master’s in International Relations and 9 years of experience as a Marketing, Branding, Sales Professional and Political Consultant. I am passionate about communication and working with a diverse team to bring new perspectives, brainstorm, and pitch ideas that will make performance stronger explaining technical concepts to non-technical audiences, analyzing go-to market strategies and driving revenue.

I became a data scientist because I’m passionate about creative problem solving for public good. I want to apply my love of science and data to challenges where I can have an impact and help others.

### Currently
Data scientist interested in solving problems for the public good. 

### What I'm up to:
* I am currently working on a project that leverages time series analysis to examine McDonald's market trends over time. The objective is to monitor shifts in customer opinions to foresee market changes and adjust strategies accordingly.
* Open to collaborate on data and machine learning projects that tell interesting stories and/or have a social impact
* Ask me about creating complex data visualizations or using Python to generate dynamic SQL queries and Excel reports.
* Goal: Visit all 62 National Parks!
